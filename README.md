# TF2 Guide
## What is this?
The learning curve to TF2 starts steep and stays that way for awhile until it plateaus, making the game manageable.  
In all honesty, aside from teaching them how to move and shoot, Valve did a horrible job teaching new players about the game's core mechanics and "meta" playstyles. To lower the slope of this learning curve and to help new players enjoy this game more, this project was created.
